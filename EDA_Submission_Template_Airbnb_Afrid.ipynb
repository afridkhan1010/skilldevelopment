        "Airbnb has provided many travellers a great, easy and convenient place to stay during their travels. Similarly, it has also given an opportunity for many to earn extra revenue by listing their properties for residents to stay. However, with so many listings available with varying prices, how can an aspiring host know what type of property to invest in if his main aim is to list it in Airbnb and earn rental revenue? Additionally, if a traveller wants to find the cheapest listing available but with certain features he prefers like 'free parking' etc, how does he know what aspects to look into to find a suitable listing? There are many factors which influence the price of a listing. Which is why we aim to find the most important factors that affect the price and more importantly the features that is common among the most expensive listings. This will allow an aspiring Airbnb host to ensure that his listing is equipped with those important features such that he will be able to charge a higher price without losing customers. Moreover, a traveller will also know the factors to look into to get the lowest price possible while having certain features he prefers.\n",
        "The Airbnb Bookings Analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive and data-driven understanding of the booking trends and patterns within the Airbnb platform. By analyzing historical data on bookings, we seek to gain insights into factors influencing booking behavior, identify popular destinations, and uncover potential opportunities for hosts and guests alike.\n",

We detected the outliers which are above and below of the interquartile range in the price column, which can be ignored since prize varies with the different location and room types. Overall, we discovered a very good number of interesting relationships between features and explained each step of the process."
