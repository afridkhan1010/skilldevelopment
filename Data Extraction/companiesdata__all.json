Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem.

We are a consultant led organisation and by hiring the best talent in the market, we provide the best to our customers. Our consultants are selected against carefully set criteria to ensure strong communication skills and the ability to solve challenging, multi-dimensional problems. As a result, we have developed a first rate team focused on delivering business value. We drive competitive advantage for our customers by enabling them to become data driven. We work collaboratively with clients to leverage their data assets and deliver innovative solutions that drive business value and growth through our five core pillars of Data & Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Digital, Customer Engagement and Cloud & Technology. We deliver this value through three service lines: - Advisory to set out the strategy and direction, - Consulting to deliver the vision and; - Managed Services to ensure ongoing operational excellence.

That’s the time we turned from a bungee jumping, pub hopping, carefree couple to basically a couple of safety wardens. Everything had to be safe, kosher & googled. When the morning sickness became a routine, we were shocked to find that there were no safer alternatives to pills and ended up having to struggle a lot. After 9 rigorous months, we were finally blessed with our tiny little bundle of joy and just like you and every other parent in the world; we too wanted the best for our cute bambino. So we wore our spyglasses & did all the possible research available. Whoa, we were shocked to see how most baby products, be it lotion or shampoo contained toxins which have proven to be harmful to the little ones. We were worried sick and it wasn’t just our baby we were worried about but also for all the little ones we knew in our friend circle. That’s when we decided to do something about it & create products which were completely safe & certified toxin free. A brand, by a parent, for the parent. A brand which develops products from world-class research and attempts to solve every little problem that we as parents face. With the aim of making products which are mum-baby friendly, toxin-free, meet stringent international standards & are basically ultra-awesome, Mamaearth was born.",

Digitally paying users have been rapidly growing in India in the last decade, but the credit card penetration in the country is still only 3.5%. We are focused on addressing the unmet credit needs of the fast growing digitally paying users by combining the convenience of everyday mobile payments with the benefits of BNPL. Founded in 2009 by Bipin Preet Singh and Upasana Taku, we commenced operations as a mobile wallet to make digital payments convenient for our users. Our use cases have since expanded to include bill payments, ecommerce shopping, food delivery, petrol pumps, large retail chains, pharmacies, kirana stores, etc. Our platform also enables peer-to-peer payments via unified payment interface (“UPI”), MobiKwik Wallet as well as MobiKwik Wallet to bank payments. Over the years we have amassed over 101 million Registered Users and more than 3 million ecommerce, physical retail and biller partners. In order to further enhance our value proposition to our online merchants, we introduced our payment gateway subsidiary Zaakpay in 2012. Zaakpay enables online websites and mobile apps to collect payments from their users using multiple payment options, including debit cards, credit cards, mobile wallets, UPI , pay later, net banking and more.",

This company was formed primarily to fill the void created by the Medical equipment companies, who were not able to provide prompt service to their existing users. Within a period of two years Technohand Services became a very popular name, especially in the Western susburbs of Mumbai. Eventually, the management decided to concentrate fully in the Ophthalmic field, since the scope of automation was quite interesting. Within two years, we were offered the dealership of popular Ophthalmic equipment brands like Optikon, Takagi and Nikon for the state of Maharashtra. We were further approached by Carl Zeiss India and were appointed their Business Partner for the State of Maharashtra and Goa. After proving ourselves consistently for 10 years, being the best Business partner in India, for all the above brands, we decided to become independent Distributor of the best brands of Ophthalmic equipment in the country.",
