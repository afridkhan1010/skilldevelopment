Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem.

A decade and half later, the conviction and hope have translated into a reputation for delivering quality B2B appointment setting. Beyond Codes Inc. has emerged as the only lead generation company which has presence in practically all the continents -- the U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific -- you name it, and you will find us there. Over the years, we have developed unique capability of delivering multilingual campaigns in almost two scores --35+ -- countries. We have a highly skilled team of more than 350 experienced professionals who work in tandem to generate leads and offer B2B appointment setting to 70+ services and product companies. 14 out of the top 20 IT/BPO companies are our client and have reposed faith in us time and again. We have established ourselves as a disruptor in this field and refuse to get drawn in any kind of competition with the traditional contact centers. Traditional contact centers are adept in handling inbound queries, whereas BCI has expertise in helping B2B organizations reach out to their target companies and decision makers therein to grow their sales pipeline. (Para change) We have developed a robust research-based calling methodology. Our in-house developed CALL SMART process coupled with intensive training program and access to multiple databases make us stand out from the old-fashioned inside sales team.",

Across the industry, technology teams were seen as failing to deliver business value and agility. We believed talented technologists focusing on delivering business initiatives were key to delivering lasting competitive advantage for our customers. Today we have over 800 team members following this vision across our offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Perth, Bengaluru, and New Zealand. We are a consultant led organisation and by hiring the best talent in the market, we provide the best to our customers. Our consultants are selected against carefully set criteria to ensure strong communication skills and the ability to solve challenging, multi-dimensional problems. As a result, we have developed a first rate team focused on delivering business value. We drive competitive advantage for our customers by enabling them to become data driven. We work collaboratively with clients to leverage their data assets and deliver innovative solutions that drive business value and growth through our five core pillars of Data & Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Digital, Customer Engagement and Cloud & Technology. We deliver this value through three service lines: - Advisory to set out the strategy and direction, - Consulting to deliver the vision and; - Managed Services to ensure ongoing operational excellence. We work with all the major technologies used in the market today and are partners with some of the largest names in the industry i.e. Google, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, Hashicorp, DBT, Fivetran, Talend, Tableau, Twilio and many more.",

Our virtual garment solutions and services connect all teams involved in the digital product lifecycle, enabling more direct collaboration and reduced lead time, whilst maintaining the intricacies of garment design. We envision our garment simulation technology to become not only the tool to create virtual garments, but also the platform to provide valuable data about garments, designs, and trends, by virtualizing every garment on Earth. Our products range from CLO (3D Design Software for apparel designers and brands), Marvelous Designer (3D Design Software for character artists in gaming and animation companies), Benefit by CLO (Virtual Fitting Platform), CLOSET (Communications and Archiving Platform for virtual garments), to Marvelous SDK (Real Time Draping Engine for games) to create a new ecosystem for virtual garments. Through these services and our continuing research and development in 3D and garment design, we are transforming the way we produce and consume garments - both tangible (actual garments from brands) and intangible (virtual garments in games and movies), for ones we wear and what our virtual characters wear.",

Simbo is based on BISLU (Brain Inspired Spoken Language Understanding) architecture which understands a human like a human! BISLU uses Universal NLU which is an alternative to Intent-based AI classification model. Universal NLU enables Simbo to transform speech to thought representations making it one of its kind and unique. Simbo’s mission is to simplify data gathering and documentation between healthcare providers and patients. Simbo has created a revolutionary technology that functions as an AI-Powered Medical Scribe. Our AI based voice recognition software enables providers to talk naturally and create clinically accurate notes, including pertinent structured data. Simbo not only understands medical jargon, it understands context, so providers can talk naturally rather than having to learn the nuances of another piece of software. Our voice enabled AI technology streamlines the work of the patient, administrative staff, clinical staff, and most important, the provider. Our solution enables the provider to create hassle free documentation, allows for more active engagement with patients, reduces the burden caused by EMRs and can save a provider up to 3 hour daily. Simbo reduces burnout, increases throughput, and enables more engaged and satisfied patients.",

That’s the time we turned from a bungee jumping, pub hopping, carefree couple to basically a couple of safety wardens. Everything had to be safe, kosher & googled. When the morning sickness became a routine, we were shocked to find that there were no safer alternatives to pills and ended up having to struggle a lot. After 9 rigorous months, we were finally blessed with our tiny little bundle of joy and just like you and every other parent in the world; we too wanted the best for our cute bambino. So we wore our spyglasses & did all the possible research available. Whoa, we were shocked to see how most baby products, be it lotion or shampoo contained toxins which have proven to be harmful to the little ones. We were worried sick and it wasn’t just our baby we were worried about but also for all the little ones we knew in our friend circle. That’s when we decided to do something about it & create products which were completely safe & certified toxin free. A brand, by a parent, for the parent. A brand which develops products from world-class research and attempts to solve every little problem that we as parents face. With the aim of making products which are mum-baby friendly, toxin-free, meet stringent international standards & are basically ultra-awesome, Mamaearth was born.",

Our use cases have since expanded to include bill payments, ecommerce shopping, food delivery, petrol pumps, large retail chains, pharmacies, kirana stores, etc. Our platform also enables peer-to-peer payments via unified payment interface (“UPI”), MobiKwik Wallet as well as MobiKwik Wallet to bank payments. Over the years we have amassed over 101 million Registered Users and more than 3 million ecommerce, physical retail and biller partners. In order to further enhance our value proposition to our online merchants, we introduced our payment gateway subsidiary Zaakpay in 2012.

This company was formed primarily to fill the void created by the Medical equipment companies, who were not able to provide prompt service to their existing users. Within a period of two years Technohand Services became a very popular name, especially in the Western susburbs of Mumbai. Eventually, the management decided to concentrate fully in the Ophthalmic field, since the scope of automation was quite interesting. Within two years, we were offered the dealership of popular Ophthalmic equipment brands like Optikon, Takagi and Nikon for the state of Maharashtra. We were further approached by Carl Zeiss India and were appointed their Business Partner for the State of Maharashtra and Goa. After proving ourselves consistently for 10 years, being the best Business partner in India, for all the above brands, we decided to become independent Distributor of the best brands of Ophthalmic equipment in the country.",
